# Abstract
Understanding the chemical compositions of stellar hosts is critical to determining the conditions under which planets form around M dwarfs. We investigate whether stars with different elemental abundances demonstrate distinct planet-hosting capabilities. We use two statistically distinct chemical composition clusters to develop a population-wide analysis of compositional trends via Bayesian inference conducted with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. We then incorporate the rate of confirmed exoplanetary hosts within each cluster to provide insight into the role of stellar chemistry in planetary formation. We found that metal-rich M dwarfs result in a more favorable environment for planet formation. Our work contributes to the broader understanding of stellar compositionâ€™s impact on the likelihood of planet formation across M dwarf systems.
